# Minimal Example Skill

This is a minimal example of a Claude skill with only the required fields.

## Purpose

This skill demonstrates the absolute minimum required to create a valid skill:
- A dedicated folder for the skill
- A SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter
- Required frontmatter fields: `name` and `description`

## Usage

Use this as a template when creating new skills. You can add more metadata
fields as needed, but `name` and `description` are always required.

## Example

```
Hello! I'm a minimal skill example.
```

That's it - simple and straightforward!
