## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that all contributors are expected to follow:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Poetry 1.7+
- Git
- Docker (optional, for container testing)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-skill-hub.git
cd mcp-skill-hub
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
poetry install
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

```bash
poetry shell
```

4. **Verify installation:**

```bash
poetry run pytest
poetry run mypy src
```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a New Feature

1. **Create a new branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write code following our standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Run tests:**

```bash
poetry run pytest
poetry run pytest --cov=mcp_skills
```

4. **Check code quality:**

```bash
poetry run black .
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run mypy src
```

5. **Commit your changes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
```

6. **Push to your fork:**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

7. **Create a pull request** on GitHub

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add validation command for skills directory
fix: resolve parser issue with nested frontmatter
docs: update README with folder structure examples
test: add integration tests for hot-reload
```

## Code Standards

### Python Style

- **Python 3.13+** with modern type hints
- **Black** for code formatting (88 character line length)
- **Ruff** for linting
- **Mypy** for type checking in strict mode

### Type Hints

All functions and methods must have complete type hints:

```python
def parse_skill(path: Path) -> Optional[Skill]:
    """Parse a skill file."""
    ...
```

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings for all public APIs:

```python
def scan(self) -> dict[str, Skill]:
    """
    Scan the skills directory for valid skill folders.

    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping skill names to Skill objects

    Raises:
        ValueError: If directory doesn't exist

    Example:
        >>> scanner = SkillScanner(Path("/skills"))
        >>> skills = scanner.scan()
    """
    ...
```

### Error Handling

- Provide detailed error messages with folder context
- Log errors appropriately
- Raise exceptions with helpful information
- Handle edge cases gracefully

Example:
```python
if not folder.exists():
    logger.error(
        f"Skill folder does not exist: {folder}\n"
        f"  Expected structure: {self.skills_dir}/<skill-name>/SKILL.md"
    )
    return None
```

### Logging

- Use module-level loggers: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- Include folder context in messages
- Use appropriate log levels:
  - `DEBUG`: Detailed diagnostic information
  - `INFO`: General informational messages
  - `WARNING`: Warning messages for recoverable issues
  - `ERROR`: Error messages for failures

Example:
```python
logger.info(f"Successfully loaded skill '{skill.name}' from folder '{folder.name}'")
logger.error(f"Failed to parse skill in folder '{folder.name}': {error}")
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

Tests are organized in the `tests/` directory:

```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ conftest.py           # Pytest fixtures
â”œâ”€â”€ test_models.py        # Model tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_parsers.py       # Parser tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_scanner.py       # Scanner tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_repository.py    # Repository tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_structure.py     # Folder structure tests
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/             # Test data
    â””â”€â”€ sample_skills/
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Use descriptive test names:**

```python
def test_skill_must_be_in_folder():
    """Test that skills not in folders are rejected."""
    ...

def test_scanner_skips_hidden_folders():
    """Test that folders starting with . are skipped."""
    ...
```

2. **Test both success and failure cases:**

```python
def test_parse_valid_skill():
    """Test parsing a valid skill succeeds."""
    ...

def test_parse_invalid_yaml_fails():
    """Test parsing invalid YAML fails gracefully."""
    ...
```

3. **Use fixtures for common setup:**

```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_skill_folder(tmp_path):
    """Create a sample skill folder for testing."""
    skill_folder = tmp_path / "test-skill"
    skill_folder.mkdir()
    skill_file = skill_folder / "SKILL.md"
    skill_file.write_text("---\nname: test\n---\n# Test")
    return skill_folder
```

4. **Test folder structure validation:**

```python
def test_validate_folder_structure_rejects_root_files():
    """Test that SKILL.md in root directory is rejected."""
    ...
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_scanner.py

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=mcp_skills --cov-report=html

# Run with verbose output
poetry run pytest -v

# Run specific test
poetry run pytest tests/test_scanner.py::test_scan_valid_skills
```

### Test Coverage
